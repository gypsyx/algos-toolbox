# algos-toolbox
This repo has my solutions to problems (in python) from the course 'algorithmic-toolbox'. Please follow the honor code if you are taking the course.

Each file has a naive and a fast (improved) solution and an accompanying stress test in a file usually named 'stress_test_..'. The interesting thing about these fast solutions is that they are based on some interesting properties relevant to the problem which may not be evident at first. Without knowing these properties it is impossible to devise a faster algorithm.
